# rtw
shameful code written by an idiot. go fuck youself

## Reinvent The Wheel

rtw is not a general purpose utility library

rtw provides the bare minimum functionality required for a specific collection of projects

rtw was written by a terrible programmer and shouldn't be held as an example of good design

rtw is free to use for any purpose. however i recommend that you do not use it for any purpose
